## Advanced Usage
### Scripting
YouTube allows content creators to automate repetitive tasks through scripting and API integration. Using YouTubeâ€™s API, you can automate video uploads, manage playlists, and retrieve analytics data. Here's an example script to automate video uploads using the YouTube Data API:

```python 
import google_auth_oauthlib.flow 
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
```

# Authenticate and build the YouTube API client
flow = google_auth_oauthlib.flow.InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file( 'client_secrets.json', scopes=["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload"]) 
credentials = flow.run_console()
 youtube = build('youtube', 'v3', credentials=credentials)

# Upload a video
request_body = {
           'snippet': {
           'title': 'Advanced YouTube Scripting',
           'description': 'This video demonstrates how to automate YouTube uploads.',
           'tags': ['YouTube', 'automation', 'tutorial'],
           'categoryId': '22' # "People & Blogs" category
           },
           'status': {
            'privacyStatus': 'public'
             }
     }
              media_file = 'video.mp4'
              upload = youtube.videos().insert(part="snippet,status", body=request_body, media_body=media_file) 
              upload.execute()
